/*
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number N on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

Choosing any x with 0 < x < N and N % x == 0.
Replacing the number N on the chalkboard with N - x.
Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.
